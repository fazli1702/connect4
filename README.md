# CONNECT 4

### Video demo: https://youtu.be/qAlR-URkgmU

This is a simple game of connect 4 where you will play against an AI.
The AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimisation. The player who starts is randomly assigned. You can play either on the terminal or using a GUI. The GUI is coded using the pygame library.  

Ensure that you have the appropriate libraries before running the program. You can do this by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can play on the terminal by running `connect4.py`
